This repository contains my submission for the Data Structures Assignment as part of the Winter Semester at McGill University. The assignment aims to provide hands-on practice with different data structures and their applications. The main focus of the assignment is the implementation of the "Caterpillar Game," a small program that involves moving a caterpillar around a map to eat food and grow.

Caterpillar Game Description:
The Caterpillar Game is a simple yet engaging program that showcases the use of data structures in a fun way. In this game, you control a caterpillar on a map, and your goal is to make the caterpillar eat all the available food.

How to Play the Caterpillar Game:

Setup: The game starts with a caterpillar (represented by a series of connected cells) and food items scattered throughout the map.
Controls: You will be able to control the direction of the caterpillar using keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys).
Movement: The caterpillar will move in the direction specified and continue moving in that direction until you change it.
Eating Food: Whenever the caterpillar's head reaches a food item, it "eats" the food and grows one cell bigger.
Win Condition: The final goal of the game is to eat all the food items on the map, making the caterpillar as long as possible.
Key Learning Objectives:

Implementing different data structures to represent the caterpillar and food on the map.
Practicing algorithms for caterpillar movement and collision detection.
Understanding the use of data structures in creating interactive games.
